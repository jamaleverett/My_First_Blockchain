# My First Blockchain

### Hi, welcome to my first blockchain that I've built!

The goal of this project was to build on my understanding of blockchain technologies by focusing on the programmatic processes involved. 

The blockchain.py file contains all the code I used for the blockchain and the requirements.txt file holds the Flask and Requests libraries that I installed.

This project was created with the help of <b>Daniel van Flymen</b> and his article <a href="https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46">Learn Blockchains by Building One</a>.

<i>Please excuse the relatively young life of this project. I was also building my understanding of Git while working on the blockchain :)</i>
